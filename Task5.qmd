1. Setup and load dataset:
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

airbnb_data <- read.csv("airbnb.csv")
```

3. Histogram (Base Plotting System):
```{r}
hist(
  airbnb_data$realSum,
  breaks = 30,
  col = "skyblue",
  main = "Distribution of Airbnb Prices",
  xlab = "Price (realSum)",
  ylab = "Frequency"
)
```

4. Scatter Plot (ggplot2):
```{r}
ggplot(airbnb_data, aes(x = dist, y = realSum, color = guest_satisfaction_overall)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "Scatter Plot of Price vs. Distance",
    x = "Distance from City Center",
    y = "Price (realSum)",
    color = "Satisfaction Rating"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

5. Boxplot (ggplot2):
```{r}
ggplot(airbnb_data, aes(x = day_type, y = realSum, fill = day_type)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "Boxplot of Prices by Day Type",
    x = "Day Type",
    y = "Price (realSum)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("weekdays" = "lightblue", "weekends" = "orange"))
```

6. Custom Plot (Bar Plot - Base Plotting System):
```{r}
top_cities <- aggregate(realSum ~ city, airbnb_data, mean)
top_cities <- top_cities[order(-top_cities$realSum), ][1:5, ]

barplot(
  top_cities$realSum,
  names.arg = top_cities$city,
  col = "lightgreen",
  main = "Top 5 Cities by Average Price",
  xlab = "City",
  ylab = "Average Price (realSum)"
)
```
